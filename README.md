## The Idea behind Open Discourse

Starting in 1949, every single spoken word in the Bundestag has been recorded - but what happens to those Protocols once they are archived? In fact, they haven't been analyzed in the past 70 years because they mostly can't be read by computers.

Open Discourse took the challenge and made every plenary protocol computer-readable and parsed the data - including meta information - into a database. Because not only the speeches are recored but also reactions by politicians or factions, we can analyze them as well.

Therefore Open Discourse opens up new possibilities for analyzing the work of the Bundestag since 1949 and hence propels the analytical possibilities of political discourse in Germany into the 21st Century. Using modern Methods like Deep- and Machine-Learning, protocols can now be examined for patterns and made available to the whole public.
