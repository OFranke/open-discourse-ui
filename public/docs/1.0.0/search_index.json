You can easily download the data in your preferred data format and use it for your projects. The following data formats are available: CSV/Tab (Universal) Pickle (Python) RDS (R) Feather (R &amp; Python) The dataverse hosts all database tables in these four formats (see Section 3 for a full documentation on the database tables). The following widget provides direct access to the data files in the dataverse: "],["run-the-database-locally.html", "2.2 Run the database locally", " 2.2 Run the database locally You can download and run a docker image of the Postgres database. The docker image contains the latest version of the database. 2.2.1 Get and launch the database Three steps are necessary to run the database on your machine: Authenticate to GitHub Container Registry Click here for a detailed documentation on how to get and use your personal access token. Pull the docker container After you are authenticated run the following command from your terminal: docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/open-discourse/open-discourse/database:latest Run the database Finally you just need to start the docker container with the database: docker run --env POSTGRES_USER=postgres --env POSTGRES_DB=postgres --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d docker.pkg.github.com/open-discourse/open-discourse/database You need to pass on some environment variables, to login to the database locally: variable value –env POSTGRES_USER postgres –env POSTGRES_DB postgres –env POSTGRES_PASSWORD postgres 2.2.2 Use the database After these steps are done, the database is running locally on port 5432. You can access the database by using a database tool (e.g. DBeaver) or by using your preferred programming language. Use following credentials to log in to your database: variable value db_name next host_db localhost db_port 5432 db_user postgres db_password postgres 2.2.3 Code examples R Code library(&quot;RPostgreSQL&quot;) # db_connection ----------------------------------------------------------- db &lt;- &quot;next&quot; host_db &lt;- &quot;localhost&quot; db_port &lt;- &quot;5432&quot; db_user &lt;- &quot;postgres&quot; db_password &lt;- &quot;postgres&quot; con &lt;- dbConnect( RPostgres::Postgres(), dbname = db, host = host_db, port = db_port, user = db_user, password = db_password ) # get data tables --------------------------------------------------------- speeches &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, &quot;SELECT * FROM open_discourse.speeches;&quot;) Python Code import psycopg2 import pandas as pd con_details = { &quot;host&quot; : &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;database&quot; : &quot;next&quot;, &quot;user&quot; : &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;password&quot; : &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;port&quot; : &quot;5432&quot; } con = psycopg2.connect(**con_details) speeches = pd.read_sql_query(&quot;select * from open_discours.speeches&quot;, con) "],["recreate-the-database-locally.html", "2.3 Recreate the database locally", " 2.3 Recreate the database locally Also, you can checkout our GitHub repository and recreate the database from scratch on your local machine or any other instance you want to run the database on. This procedure is the most time consuming way to access the data. The recreation of the database from scratch includes downloading all raw plenary protocols from the website fo the German Bundestag, the full processing procedure of these files and the creation of the postgres database.

This report is supplementary to a soon to be published data paper. The Open Discourse Corpus consists of five main tables. This report provides information about the contents of these tables and the meaning of the respective variables. A detailed documentation about the procedures used to provide this corpus can be found in aforementioned data paper soon. Furthermore the codebase developed and used to create the corpus can be retrieved from GitHub. This open source codebase can be used to recreate the database from scratch and to contribute to the repository to further improve the quality of the data. A current data dump can be found at the associated Dataverse. Also, a full text search engine for researching the corpus can be found on the Open Discourse Website (currently only available in German).

See additional remarks below for further details. factionId integer64 22 58.85% Foreign key of the faction. This ID can be used to link the observations with the factions table.

It is divided into a short, generic form and a long form. The positionLong variable is the exact extraction of the functional description of the speaker as can be found in the original protocol. The positionShort variable is a factor variable of seven different levels. The list below provides more information about the meaning of the seven levels.   Short Position Mapping: positionShort Description Chancellor The federal chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. Guest Every speaker that does not belong to the other positionShort levels and thus is an external person. Member of Parliament Every speaker that is mentioned alongside a faction abbreviation is considered a MP. Minister Every speaker that has the function of a minister of state is a minister. Not Found No positionShort information could be retrieved from the protocol. Presidium of Parliament This category contains all speeches held by the (Vice-)Presidents of the Bundestag, the Father/Mother of the House (“Alterspräsident_in”), as well as secretaries (“Schriftführer_in”). Secretary of State This category contains both the permanent secretaries (beamtete Staatssekretär_in) as well as secretaries of state (parlamentarische Staatssekretär_in). 3.2.2.2 Speech Content Variable NOTICE! The speech content variable only contains the actual spoken words of the respective politician. Any kind of interjection or reaction from the plenum is deleted from the speech content variable and replaced by a positional ID in the format of ({ID}). This positional id can be used to link each speech with every contribution during the speech. The contributions can be found in the two contributions tables. Furthermore the positional ID represents the exact order and position a contribution occurred and hence can be used to reassemble the original structure of the speeches and interjections/contributions.

The Open Discourse corpus only contains a selection of the publicly available personal details of the politicians. A comprehensive resource of the available meta data can be found on the website of the Bundestag. There are some rare cases in which people were members of the government but never held a mandate as a member of the parliament. These politicians are not covered in the base data mentioned above. To fill this gap in the base data, we merge the file with data retrieved from Wikipedia. "],["contribs.html", "3.5 Contributions Tables", " 3.5 Contributions Tables The current version of the Open Discourse database contains two contributions tables. Contributions are any kind of interjections and other types of reactions during a speech from the plenum that is recorded by the stenographers. There is a simplified version of the contributions table and an extended one. The simplified version only contains the raw text of the interjection and two foreign keys to map the contribution to the associated speech and the precise position in the speech where the contribution occurred. The extended contributions table has more detailed meta information but the instances in this table can be faulty. The logic needs further refinement for better results - still we wanted to provide the current state of this approach and hence we labeled this table as being experimental. 3.5.1 Contributions Simplified Click here for a table preview id textPosition speechId content 0 0 2 (Der Bundespräsident leistet diesen Eid.) 1 4 5 (dem Bundespräsidenten die Hand reichend) 2 3 5 (Langanhaltender lebhafter Beifall.) 3 2 5 (Bundespräsident Dr. Heuss) 4 1 5 (Sehr richtig!) 5 0 5 (Bundespräsident Dr. Heuss) 6 7 6 (Lachen links. - Zurufe.) 7 6 6 (Ja-Rufe.) 8 5 6 (Die Ermittlung des Ergebnisses wird fortgesetzt.) 9 4 6 (Präsident Dr. Köhler) this preview depicts the first 10 rows of the contributions simplified table.
